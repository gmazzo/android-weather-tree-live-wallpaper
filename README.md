This project is a slowing migration to a modern setup as an attempt to keep it up to date with the Android ecosystem and keep it functional.

> [!NOTE]
> I kept this to run it on my own devices, just because I liked it very much and it suddenly disappeared from Google Play.
> I do not offer any guarantee or maintenance support rather than for my own needs for it.
